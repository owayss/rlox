// This listing demonstrates a current bug the rlox interpreter has:
// because functions are not bound to the scope in which they get created,
// this code will print "block" on the second call to showA(), where it should
// have printed "global" instead.
var a = "global";
{
    fn showA() {
        print a;
    }
    showA();
    var a = "block";
    showA();
